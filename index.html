<h1>GitHub</h1>
<p id="para1">GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects. As of May 2011, GitHub was the most popular open source code repository site.
GitHub Inc. was founded in 2008 and is based in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p class="para2">GitHub also operates other services: a pastebin-style site called Gist that provides wikis for individual repositories and web pages that can be edited through a Git repository, a slide hosting service called Speaker deck, and a web analytics platform called Gauges.</p>
